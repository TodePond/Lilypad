# Intent

This page sets out the intentions and goals of the Lilypad server.

## Specific purpose

The server does not intend to be a general purpose community. That is, it doesn't intend to be a place for all types of topics and types of expression.

Instead, it intends to be a place for a limited range of topics and .

Those topics are:<br>
⭐ coding + creativity<br>
⭐ nature + cellular automata

And the server is strictly for **celebrating** those topics.

> **Rationale:**
> 
> 1. It helps to make moderation easier and less time-consuming, as the server doesn't have to accommodate such a wide range of discussions.
> 2. It helps to focus the server in a specific direction, giving it more of a clear purpose and direction.
> 3. It takes inspiration from the traditional sharing communities of falling sand games, such as the Powder Toy, which is what the TodePond youtube channel originates from.
> 
> Not everyone wants such a specific purpose, and that's ok. Some people would rather be part of a more general-purpose community. The Lilypad server doesn't have to be what everyone wants.

## Slow and small

The server does not intend to be as big or as fast-paced as most discord servers.

Instead, it intends to be small and slow enough for someone to reasonably read all new messages by checking in once per day.

> **Rationale:**
> 
> 1. There is a lot of joy to be had from being part of a discord server (or equivalent). Many people miss out on this joy because they can't keep up with the scale and speed of most servers - for various reasons.
> 2. The server intends to promote a healthier screen-life balance. It doesn't want to encourage or motivate people to be 'terminally-online', or spend too spend too much time staring at their phone/computer.

## Diverse

The server intends to be comprised of users from wide and diverse backgrounds and demographics, especially those that are under-represented within the tech and online world.

> **Rationale:**
> 
> 1. No explanation needed.

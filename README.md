# The Lilypad

The Lilypad is the TodePond discord server.

## Repo

This repo contains information about the server, its structure, its rules, etc.

It allows me (TodePond) to be more transparent about the running of the server. It also gives the community a place to discuss the server somewhere that isn't tangled up with the server itself.

## Contribute

If you would like to suggest a change, you can **submit a pull request**. Just click "edit" on a file, make your changes, and then submit the request. If you want to change multiple files, you can continue editing your pull request's branch with further changes.

You can also **[raise an issue](https://github.com/TodePond/TheLilypad/issues/new)** to suggest something that could be improved.

You can also browse all open [**issues**](https://github.com/TodePond/TheLilypad/issues) and [**pull requests**](https://github.com/TodePond/TheLilypad/pulls) to see what might need figuring out.

> **Submitting a pull request** is better when you have a clear idea of what the change should be.
>
> **Raising an issue** is better when there is something that could be improved, but you aren't sure how.

Anyone can contribute! If you want to contribute, but you aren't sure how to do it properly, please feel free to ask @TodePond for help (on discord, mastodon, twitter, or anywhere else).

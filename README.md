# The Lilypad

The Lilypad is the TodePond discord server.<br>
It can joined by signing up on [patreon](https://patreon.com/TodePond), [substack](https://todepond.substack.com), or [liberapay](https://liberapay.com/TodePond).

**This repo contains information about the server, its structure, its rules, etc.**

It allows me (TodePond) to be more transparent about the running of the server. It also gives the community a place to discuss the server â€” somewhere that isn't tangled up with the server itself.

## Current status

This repo is in alpha, and is still a work-in-progress. This means that it's still missing a lot of information about the server, so it can't be used for certain things yet. For example, it doesn't contain any information about the [server's settings](https://github.com/TodePond/Lilypad/issues/17), so it can't be used to suggest changes to those (yet).

However, it does contain *some* information. For example, it lists all the [channels](pages/channels.md) of the server, so it *can* be used to suggest changes to those.

The discord server stays in sync with the latest release of the repo. The main branch can be 'ahead' of the server. When the main branch seems stable enough, a release gets created, and the discord server will be updated accordingly.
